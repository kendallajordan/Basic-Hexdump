 Project: Assignment #1: Basic Hexdump Program
 File: README
 Last Date Modified: Feb 18, 2019

 Project Description:
 	This project is a basic hexadecimal file dump program, or 'xbd'.
 	
 	It opens a regular type file (containing binary or text/ASCII content),
 	reads every byte in the file, and writes it's hex-value and printable
 	(human-readable) character to standard output. 

 	Bytes forming non-printable characters shall print a '.' character instead.

 File manifest:
 	README
 	Makefile
 	hexdump.cpp
 	hexdump.h

 Compile instructions:
 	1) Open the command terminal.
 	2) Move into the directory containing all the files of this project.
 	3) Run the following command to compile the executable file:
 			make
 	4) The following object file(s) will now be in the project directory:
 			hexdump.o
 	5) The following executable file(s) will now be in the project directory:
 			xbd

 Operating instructions:
 	1) Open the command terminal.
 	2) Move into the directory containing all the files of this project.
 	3) Run either of the following commands:
 			xbd <FILENAME>
 			xbd -b <FILENAME>
 	4) Replace <FILENAME> with a file from the project directory.
 	5) The first command in step 3 will execute a basic hexdump program,
 		dumping the specified file in ASCII/hex format.
 	6) The second command in step 3 will execute a "binary dump",
 		dumping the specified file in binary format.

 	** WARNING - This program was built to only open 
 	regular file types (binary or text/ASCII content). **

 List/description of any extra features/algorithms/functionality you included which were not required
 	- Included a header table at the start of the hexdump/binary dump to label and identify
 		the address, data values, and printable character columns.
